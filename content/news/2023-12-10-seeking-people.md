GranadaCoders is still actively looking for people, projects and links to 
feature on this site. So far we have a couple of Coders, and several 
projects by Tero Keski-Valkama mostly related to AI.
If you know of links to relevant sites, please get in touch! You can add yourself here by just making a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/keskival/granadacoders.es). It's free and no nonsense.
