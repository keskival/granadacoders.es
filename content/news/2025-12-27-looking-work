I have very recently become available for new opportunities.

Even though my most recent experience is in generalist foundation model for oncology and healthcare, my experience spans over 25 years of software engineering, robotics and AI across numerous domains and roles.

My passions are in artificial general intelligence, robotic foundation models, physical foundation models and drones.

If you want me in your ambitious team to work on pushing the envelope in AI, send me a message on LinkedIn!
